# To-Do List Application

A simple and lightweight To-Do List application that allows users to add, check, and delete tasks. The tasks are stored locally using the browser's `localStorage`, ensuring persistence even after refreshing the page.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Enter and add tasks to your list.
- **Mark as Complete**: Toggle task completion with a click.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove tasks with a delete button.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in local storage and persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Core functionality and interaction handling.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Task**: Enter a task in the input field and press the add button. The task will appear in the list.
2. **Mark as Complete**: Click on a task to toggle its completion status. Completed tasks are visually differentiated.
3. **Delete a Task**: Click on the "Ã—" icon next to any task to remove it from the list.
4. **Data Persistence**: The tasks will be automatically saved to the browser's local storage. If you reload the page, the previously added tasks will still be visible.
